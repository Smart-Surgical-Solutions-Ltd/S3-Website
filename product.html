        <p>
          M.A.R.I.O is a cutting-edge platform technology designed for seamless surgical navigation. Once the patient's
          medical
          image is uploaded to our portal, we take care of everything—including image processing and navigation model
          training.
          The user simply needs to load the prepared model onto their smartphone just before surgery. During the
          procedure, they
          can effortlessly follow on-screen guidance to determine the optimal pin placement for securing the standard
          cutting jig.
          With no waiting time, a hassle-free workflow, and complete flexibility, M.A.R.I.O streamlines the surgical
          process like
          never before.

        <p>
          We have implemented a robust testing protocol and conducted
          usability assessments involving surgeons using device design #1.
          Participants provided valuable feedback through questionnaires, as
          outlined in our testing methodology. Both average location and
          angular errors exceeded clinically acceptable thresholds, set at 3
          mm for location and 3° for angular error. This real-world usage and
          feedback collection process unveiled key insights.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          During these usability assessments, it became evident that the pilot
          holes designed for the installation of referential pins in design #1
          were too loose, causing difficulties for the participants during the
          surgery. In response to this feedback, we made substantial
          improvements in our design approach, leading to the development of
          design #2.<br />
          The results obtained with design #2 demonstrated remarkable
          improvements in performance compared to design #1. Errors in
          location and angular measurements consistently fell below the
          clinically acceptable thresholds, with significantly reduced
          variations between data points. Notably, location errors
          consistently remained below the 3 mm threshold, aligning with
          clinically accepted standards. While the sagittal plane exhibited
          slightly larger errors compared to the transverse plane, the overall
          average error remained within acceptable clinical limits.

            Our rigorous laboratory validation process conclusively affirms
            the efficacy of the M.A.R.I.O device. Its capacity to achieve
            implant alignment with remarkable accuracy has the potential to
            revolutionise total knee arthroplasty procedures, offering the
            prospect of reduced complications and improved patient well-being.
            This technology stands as a game-changer in the field, enhancing
            surgical outcomes and marking a significant advancement in
            orthopaedic care.
