          <h2>Total knee replacement</h2>
          <p>
            Total knee replacement (TKR) to replace joints with osteoarthritis
            is a highly effective procedure to treat this type of knee pain,
            resulting in a dramatic reduction in pain, restoration of function,
            and improved quality of life. In 2019 (pre-COVID), around 100,000
            and 1,000,000 surgeries were performed in the UK and the US,
            respectively. This number is predicted to continue to rapidly
            increase due to demographic and lifestyle changes, particularly an
            ageing population, and increasing levels of obesity. Although TKR is
            a very successful operation overall, inaccuracies in implant
            positioning and ligament tension of up to 30% have been reported
            using conventional techniques. This is associated with pain and
            instability, and is a significant determinant of need for further
            (revision) surgery (~ 7% of TKRs are revised every year).
          </p>
          <p>
            A primary total knee replacement costs approximately £6,500 and
            $10,000 in the UK and US, respectively. More than 80% of these
            procedures are done using conventional instrumentation which has
            been the gold standard for more than 20 years. This approach has
            been found to deliver inaccurate implant positioning in up to 30% of
            cases, independent of the surgeon’s experience. Indeed,
            approximately 7% of TKRs are revised every year, a procedure which
            is technically challenging, and has a high failure rate, with
            further revision surgery necessary in 22% of these cases within 5
            years. Malpositioned knee replacements resulting in post-operative
            pain and reduced joint function significantly impact patients’
            quality of life, as well as impacting their families and carers.
            There is also a significant impact on society given that these
            patients are unlikely to return to work. Revision surgery is also
            expensive, costing £10k on average, and is estimated to cost the NHS
            £67m annually when wider healthcare costs are considered. These
            issues are set to become more prevalent as the number of patients
            requiring knee replacement surgery is predicted to rise
            significantly in the coming years.
          </p>
          <h2>M.A.R.I.O</h2>
          <p>
            The navigation device we are developing is easy to use and with no
            investment required from healthcare providers such as the NHS. The
            device will help surgeons place implants in the best possible
            position, ensuring optimum ligament balancing. This is expected to
            improve patient satisfaction and long-term outcomes. The current
            M.A.R.I.O system is designed for knee joint replacement but the
            technology is easily transferable to other joint replacement and
            orthopaedic procedures. The system consists of a pre-operative
            surgical planner and navigation software which are provided free of
            charge. We are confident this will contribute to the surgical
            training of the next generation of orthopaedic surgeons, improve
            surgical outcomes and in doing so, reduce the financial burden on
            the NHS.

            We have implemented a robust testing protocol and conducted
            usability assessments involving surgeons using device design #1.
            Participants provided valuable feedback through questionnaires, as
            outlined in our testing methodology. Both average location and
            angular errors exceeded clinically acceptable thresholds, set at 3
            mm for location and 3° for angular error. This real-world usage and
            feedback collection process unveiled key insights.
          </p>

            During these usability assessments, it became evident that the pilot
            holes designed for the installation of referential pins in design #1
            were too loose, causing difficulties for the participants during the
            surgery. In response to this feedback, we made substantial
            improvements in our design approach, leading to the development of
            design #2.<br />
            The results obtained with design #2 demonstrated remarkable
            improvements in performance compared to design #1. Errors in
            location and angular measurements consistently fell below the
            clinically acceptable thresholds, with significantly reduced
            variations between data points. Notably, location errors
            consistently remained below the 3 mm threshold, aligning with
            clinically accepted standards. While the sagittal plane exhibited
            slightly larger errors compared to the transverse plane, the overall
            average error remained within acceptable clinical limits.

              Our rigorous laboratory validation process conclusively affirms
              the efficacy of the M.A.R.I.O device. Its capacity to achieve
              implant alignment with remarkable accuracy has the potential to
              revolutionise total knee arthroplasty procedures, offering the
              prospect of reduced complications and improved patient well-being.
              This technology stands as a game-changer in the field, enhancing
              surgical outcomes and marking a significant advancement in
              orthopaedic care.
